# SVMXplorer
Visualize and Explore Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with SVMXplorer. This interactive tool allows you to interactively plot and classify data points, adjust SVM parameters in real-time, and visualize decision boundaries. Gain insights into the inner workings of SVMs and experiment with different kernels and hyperparameters. 

A Python project that allows you to interactively visualize and explore Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using matplotlib and widgets.

# Features
* Interactive plot: Click on the plot to add data points belonging to two classes.
* Real-time training: The SVM model is trained on the collected data points and the decision boundary is updated in real-time.
* Customizable parameters: Use buttons, sliders, and radio buttons to adjust the SVM model's kernel type, gamma value, and other parameters.

# Usage
1. Run the svm_plot.py script.
2. Interact with the plot:
   * Left-click on the plot to add data points for class P.
   * Right-click on the plot to add data points for class N.
   * Use the buttons, sliders, and radio buttons to customize the SVM model's parameters.
3. Explore the SVM model:
   * Observe the updated decision boundary as you add points and adjust the parameters.
   * Experiment with different kernel types, gamma values, and other parameters to see their effects on the model's behavior.
